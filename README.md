This project is designed to build an AI model based on the transformer architecture for neural machine translation (NMT).

**Supported language pair:** French ➡️ English


## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- pip


## 🚧 Development Setup

1. Navigate to the root of the project: `cd /path/to/project`  
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`  
3. Activate the virtual environment:  
   - On Linux/macOS: `source .venv/bin/activate`  
   - On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`  
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
5. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and add the required environment variables.

**Now you can develop the model** — open and run `main.ipynb` to get started.
